# Passenger's App

Passengers who pay by cash will have no need for this app. Cashless passengers will make use of a mobile app to transact. Here is what the passengerâ€™s app will do.

    - Bus route (e.g., green)
    - Date, time, and location of both pickup and drop locations
    - Number of tickets purchased
    - Whether a fine was incurred
    - Fare paid
- Top up their account
- Create/delete their account
- QR code to transact
- Here's the wireframe for transactions.
