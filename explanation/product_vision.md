# Product Vision

## For Passengers

For BMTC passengers who need better bus systems, Osmosis is an app that prevents conductors from making petty thefts, provides real time bus routes, and provides cashless transactions. Unlike the existing BMTC app, our product saves time and money.

## For Administrators

For BMTC administrators who need to effectively plan bus routes, Osmosis is an admin panel that provides analytics such as heatmaps for identifying planning efficiency during rush hour, and charts for viewing trends. Unlike the current BMTC system, our product provides deep actionable insights from data that isnâ€™t incorrectly collected from negligent bus conductors.
