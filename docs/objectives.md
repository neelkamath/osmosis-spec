# Objectives

Here are the numerous issues the BMTC faces which Osmosis will fix.
- Consumers do not know the real bus routes and timings because the provided schedules do not show bus movements in real time.
- Conductors make petty thefts by incorrectly billing the customer for a stop different from the one they asked for.
- Negligent conductors cause for analytics to suffer, thereby making it difficult to effectively plan bus routes.
- Riders cannot go cashless.
