We follow a naming strategy similar to major companies such as Uber. The suite of products (aka company, organization, etc.) will be called **Osmosis**. The passenger, conductor, and admin's apps will be named **Osmosis**, **Osmosis Conductor**, and **Osmosis Admin** respectively. The backend powering the apps will be named **Osmosis Server**.
